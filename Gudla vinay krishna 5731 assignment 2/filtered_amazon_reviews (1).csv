In all that time the only problem I ever had was with the charger, which did not work unless I had it plugged in at a very specific angle. I called tech support and they sent me a new charger, free of charge, just to make sure it was the charger and not the device. The woman I spoke to was very helpful and it turned out the new charger worked fine so the original charger was defective, not my Kindle. Both my son and I loved playing games and reading books on the Kindle Fire and occasionally watching videos we downloaded. We used it on a daily basis and I was very sad when I broke it. I had taken it to an eye doctor appointment so I could read while I waited and that is where the accident happened. As I rolled the chair over to the glaucoma testing machine, my Kindle flew out of my lap and slammed into the metal base of the machine...I guess I was rolling a little too enthusiastically. The device appeared to be fine, the screen didn't even have a scratch on it, but when I turned it on all I had was a half blue/half black screen. I haven't called tech support because it was a great excuse for me to get the new, larger Kindle Fire I had been thinking about buying anyway. I don't understand the negative reviews of this product at all; if my Kindle can slam into the metal base of a machine and not break the screen, I have a hard time believing falling three feet on to grass or off the arm of the living room chair can break the screen. I suspect  the negative reviews are exaggerated by people upset at their own or their kid's clumsiness.

The phone app is okay in a reading emergency, but I find it is not quite heavy enough to wake me up when it hits me in the face if I have fallen asleep while reading ;)  So, my newest Fire gets 5 stars because finally the designers were thinking like actual Kindle users by putting the power button at the top of the device instead of at the bottom where it was too easy to accidentally power cycle.  The charging port is at the top as well which is nice.  Otherwise, this device is pretty much the same as the last one.  Good job Amazon!",2015-08-27,1

The tablet is nice looking and has an exceptionally vibrant screen.  I read comments about the OS not being a &#34;real&#34; Andriod, but I've been able to load(or side load) all of the apps I've been using on my iPhone. The only app I haven't managed to install that had caused some issues has been Google Play. A couple of the side loaded Google apps say they need it, but then the continue to function as normal. I'm not sure why Amazon doesn't allow the loading of the Google apps, just to make the customer's life easier.  The tablet speed is quite adequate about 98% of the time, but on rare occasion things sort of stop, then catch back up.<br /><br />A couple of complaints.  I've only been using the Fire for roughly two weeks, but it does not seem to have overwhelming battery life.  If I use it a lot I would probably charge it daily.  One of the reasons I was replacing my Nook Color was that I had to charge it every 4 days. That's not a completely fair comparison as I'm doing much more on the Fire, but I had hoped the battery would last longer. I've installed utilities to give me some visibility into battery usage, but there doesn't seem to be much I can do to help other than possibly turn off the Wifi some, but that's not why you buy a tablet is it?<br /><br />Second complaint is about accessories.  I guess there is confusion about the various versions that are in some way a Kindle Fire 7, but not the HD 4th generation. I had a hard time finding a case locally, other than the odd one sold by Amazon, or generic cases with hooks on the side.  I ordered one from Amazon.com that was supposed to work, but turns out even though it said it was for my machine it really wasn't. I finally found a non-Prime seller that has a good, reasonable priced case, it just took a while. And unlike anything starting with an &#34;i&#34; or a Galaxy, it is hard to find accessories locally, and I live in a big town.<br /><br />I purchasedit on &#34;Prime Day&#34; for $79, and at that price the Fire 7 HD is an exceptional value.  Would I feel the same had I paid $139? I'm not sure. At full price I probably would have purchased the Nook Galaxy Note Tab 7, primarily because it has an SD slot.",2015-08-26,1

It's an extraordinarily fast device for the price with a brilliant screen. I understood the limitations with the Amazon Marketplace and bought it anyway. However, Fire OS leaves a lot to be desired. This device will not screen cast to my Fire TV. I see no reason for this limitation. In fact, it will not allow Chromecast at all.So, I was going to give this a 3 star review. But if you install Fire OS 5.0, all that changes. You now have a nearly basic Lollipop experience. Did Amazon give up on the Fire OS Carousel? I don't know. All I know is I can have wallpapers and widgets again. You can even install launchers and any google apps. I can now use Chromecast with Netflix. I still can't cast Amazon Prime Instant Videos. I can even install side load play store apps.<br /><br />There is only one con and that is the keyboard. It is very slow to respond. Takes a few seconds to load. Then even when it is displayed, it is isn't done loading so I often type 3 letters that never show up. I finish typing and wait a few more seconds for the letters to catch up to my typing. But since I am missing the first 3, I have to start over again. If you use this as media device, this is not an issue. But if you do light forum discussions as I do, then it is too distracting for my tablet browsing experience. I have confirmed this behavior on 3 other Fird HD 7's owned by my family so it isn't limited to my device. I noticed the issue with all Fire OS 4.x thus far.

Gee, I can just access the heavenly cloud anytime I want, read a book, then send it back to heaven!  Really?  Who controls the cloud?  I don't.  I want my books on my device and where I can get to them without the grace of the Cloud hovering over me.  And yes, it's possible.  One at a time.  Why the hell did I do this to myself?

I thought Amazon was ''the one''. I  decided to commit and became a prime member. Me and Amazon together forever.  So when Amazon decided to have a day dedicated to me- its prime member-I felt obliged to reciprocate by purchasing a Fire HD. My IPad Mini had recently left me a widow, so the timing was perfect. It was meant to be.  Finally, my new late night reading companion arrived.  Well, you can imagine my horror when I charged it up, turned it on, and some buxom babe advertising a game app popped up on my screen.  Amazon knew I would not want this constant reminder of my beloved's two-timing ways, and offered to discontinue this advertising affair for an extortion fee of $15. I felt so used. But what's a girl to do? Obviously, I was never special. No doubt there were signs (and small print) that I missed. But love can be blind. Yes, our relationship has continued.

Say I'm connected but I step away from it for an hour, when I come back to it, I'll have to spend another 5-10 minutes trying to get it to reconnect again which is seriously annoying.<br /><br />However, as an eReader, I enjoy the different backgrounds and fonts that suit my likes, as well as the number of books I can load to it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a colored eReader, this gets a plus but for anyone who wants to use this as a respectable tablet too, I'd get something else for apps.",2015-08-12,0

The first few days it worked alright, it was a little slow when I did anything besides reading books, even checking my email.  I knew I would only be able to download apps from the Amazon store but as I had never used it before I was unaware how limited it was.  After 5 days (Yes, 5!!!) the screen became stuck on landscape mode.  I tried everything I could think of to fix it but nothing helped so I finally contacted customer service.  After repeating everything I'd already done (turning screen rotation on & off and turning the device on and off) they told me we would have to do a factory reset.  I attempted to do the factory reset while still on the phone with customer service and the screen just froze on the loading screen.  After waiting several minutes the customer service rep said he had done everything he could and they would send me a replacement.  I received the replacement quickly but this one only worked for one day before messing up in a completely different way.  The screen partially froze, I could click on some things but pretty much nothing reacted .  I couldn't open or close anything at all.  I couldn't even get the device to shut off!  After setting the device down and leaving it for about 20 minutes to talk to someone from customer service again I came back to find the bottom half of the screen completely black.  You could still see the image on the top half of the device but the bottom half was all black.  At that point I decided to return the device and not try a 3rd time.<br /><br />I am aware that these things happen sometimes with devices (odd that it happened to 2 of mine) so I am not giving it a 1 star.  Also, Amazon Customer Service was very helpful during the whole thing and they made the process bearable.",2015-08-12,0

It has better sound, way better video and the interface is much smother and easier to use that the other two mentioned.  This is the best 7&#34; tablet I have tried excluding the iPad Mini.<br />Two cons:<br />1. The adds that are run when you first turn the tablet on but hey I can live with that for $80 (Amazon Black Friday in July) compared to $140 - $200 for all the others in the same price range.<br />2. Lack of a mini SD slot.  The 8GB internal memory is more than enough for my use but compared other two that had limited 1gb of internal memory that filled up quickly even though you could move some of the apps to the miniSD.  This meant that I had to constantly move and delete stuff to keep the other two from filling up.<br />I know that the others mentioned are older models but they were disappointing out of the box.  I actually use this tablet for home and basic work application and have been exceedingly pleased with the purchase.  I'm sure there are comparable 7&#34; tablets out but not for the same price unless the other major brands have stepped up significantly.  Note that I also in-store tested the HP, Asus Memo and LG versions and although they were marginally better than the two listed they were also $50 more at the time.

So I tried calling and had someone on the phone right away. Unfortunately, this customer service experience was highly disappointing. I explained my issue and concern with the devices virus protection and was given a response that left me feeling responsible for the virus. He stated that the likely culprit was a web site I visited or an app I downloaded. Ultimately, they concluded that the only solution was reset to factory defaults. Meaning the device is wiped and I'm left to set it up again. No apology or suggestions on how to prevent this were offered. Or maybe it was just lost in translation because it was an offshore call center.<br /><br />The user interface is frustrating.

I got this new one as a mother's day gift to myself and the only advantages are that it's newer and has a warranty and it's faster. That's it. My problems with it:<br /><br />-i paid the same amount of money for less memory and can do without the additional camera if that's what is making up the difference. I'm not one of those people who uses their ipad as a camera. I have space efficient cameras and phones for that.<br />-the battery life is junk. My old kindle would last a few days on a charge coming and going. This one sits overnight and the next morning you have to charge it. It drains just sitting there doing nothing.<br />-sound issues: it makes an obnoxious noise in my headphones when connecting to things that play sound and for the longest time i was having problems with the volume fluctuating so drastically i could either barely hear or it was blowing out my ears. I was constantly having to adjust volume. Amazons answer: bluetooth headphones with microphones aren't compatible with the new kindle fire. That's all that exists. Turns out the pop of Facebook notifications was what was making the volume fluctuate.<br /><br />I'm just not impressed. It's not much of an improvement over what I've already got.,2015-08-09,0

I got a fire he in 2012 while that one is slightly bigger and just a hair higher in weight the beveled edges make a great way to hold the device while reading. This new one was 100.00 for prime day so I got one. I was planning on giving the old one to my daughter for her movies and I keep the new one. Well it's bulky and thick there is no bevel its likely a strain holding it while reading. It bugs me why they couldn't keep the same casing for the device, it's like they crammed the technology thicker rather than a couple of mm longer. Now I have no problems with the 2012 version. Isn't newer supposed to be better? I can't believe Amazon designers for the fire HD 2014 7 inch version would miss such a detail. Maybe it's something I'll become accustomed to and yes books are thicker but they bend and conform to hands. Anyone else a reader here. What do you think about the thickness. My I pad isn't this thick. I don't want a hand strap I already found a nice over I like. Sometimes I profit on a pillow but I'll shift positions and still like to hold the kindle to read. I could do so for hours with the other version. I haven't read a lot yet with this thick behemoth so the verdict isn't out yet totally if it's a bust, but surely others like the older models version of the casing shape. Keep in mind the cases for both are same thickness it's the edgi g that makes it less easy to ergonomically hold you need more thumb pressure to counter the thicker non beveled device where the older version counterbalance nicely between the fingers. Even nicer with the case on but I took the comparison photos with naked kindles for side by side look",2015-08-08,0

The screen for watching videos is crisper and there is faster processing for streaming so less pixelation.  I like that there is a synopses of each book attached to the ebook.  However, I owned a previous iteration of the Kindle Fire and I actually liked it better.  It was less sensitive to screen rotation.  This version freaks out quickly and cant decided which rotation to use if you are laying down reading.  The older version would go to sleep and easily waken when you touched the screen.  This version goes blank and wont waken.  It either requires a reboot or closing and opening the book cover to bring up the wake screen.  The back arrow doesnt always go back - it sometimes seems to catch and freeze.  The remove from carousel or device in this version requires an additional step which I found annoying after never having two steps in the previous version.  The advertisements are incredibly annoying to have to swipe off.  There isnt an option to turn them off but as a PRIME customer I feel this is complete overkill.

The advertisements truly are non-intrusive, so all but the most ad-averse probably don't need to spring for the extra money to get rid of them. I'm not giving it five stars due to two drawbacks that really irk me -- the first is the limited number of downloadable options on Amazon Prime. The second drawback is that this can't be connected to a TV, at least not without WiFi (and the specific reason I bought this was for watching videos in a remote location where I don't have a WiFi connection -- in locations where I do have WiFi, there are already other entertainment options).

I purchased it for approximately $150 and used it almost 24/7 for almost 3 years.  I used it to play music, stream music, watch movies/shows, manage and edit photos and graphics, listen to audio books, participate in social media, send/read e-mail from 3 different accounts and even occasional read books.  I used it at the office, at the beach, in the car, in the woods and in every room of my home.  I have taken my Kindle EVERYWHERE - EVERYDAY.  I have dropped the Kindle, spilled beverages on the Kindle, tossed the Kindle around, sat/slept on the Kindle,  allowed small kids to use the kindle,  and once my cat puked on my Kindle.  My Kindle HD held up to all of the abuse and kept ticking.  I found the promotional ads easy to ignore.  The text to speech function for mobi documents has been a lifesaver - and is possibly my favorite feature.  Given how much I used the Kindle and how little I paid for it -- this was one of the most cost effective purchases of my lifetime. While there are probably other tablets that do more and do it better --- the Kindle HD is still an AMAZING value. The only cons were the lack of availability for some desired apps (Instagram) and the durability of the charging port.  My Kindle was originally purchased without a charger and that was an added cost.  Eventually, even with an official Kindle charger from Amazon the charging port wore out.  For the last 6 months it has become increasing difficult to get the Kindle to charge and to stay charged.  After consulting with very helpful Amazon tech support staff, my Kindle has been declared dead and I have ordered an new Kindle Fire HDX -- this time a 32g model to store more audio books and photos.",2015-07-30,1

It was never mishandled or dropped. It simply stopped working. These things are too inexpensive to warrant repair so that was the end of that. I told myself at the time I would not buy another, but my one year old iPad just malfunctioned! That's right. After a year, the headset receptacle failed, and it is more expensive to repair than it is to buy a Kindle Fire, so here I am again with a new one. For the money, it is fair to say the Kindle Fire is a reasonable purchase. I won't go into packaging and other factors that are irrelevant to watching media. Let me start by saying the icons and other information on the screen is way too small for me to read without a magnifying glass. Admittedly, my old eyes are not what they were, but really, this is an avoidable problem Amazon. The data on the screen should be easily readable even by me, by going to &#34;Settings.&#34; Except there is no &#34;Settings.&#34; Secondly, when you power on the device, a pop-up add appears. I didn't buy a Kindle Fire so I would be forced to look at adds for diapers and women's vaginal cream. I want to see a nice clean screen. The Amazon logo would be okay, or a view of mountain peaks perhaps... Thirdly, a list of  options is stretched across the top of the home screen in small print and below that, are a series of icons. This is not intuitive arrangement and does not flow cognitively. Come on Amazon, find a better means of presentation. I looked at the apps on the Kindle Fire, and it's apparent I'm not through with the iPad. Many of the apps on iPad are not available on the Kindle Fire even though they are free. All this being said, picture quality is very good, and so is sound quality, the two main factors is judging the value of device. I have Amazon Prime, a wonderful service offering countless free movies and TV shows, including Amazon exclusives like House of Cards, and I can find old black and white movies on Amazon too, not available on Netflix for instance, like In Harm's Way, with John Wayne. All in all, I give the Kindle Fire three stars. This will change however, if my current Kindle Fire dies as soon as the last one did.

The device started having problems just a few months after we bought it, with it constantly rebooting.  I contacted Amazon about the issue and they sent me another device as there seemed to be a hardware problem.  Now after just one year since their replacement device arrived it is now failing again.  This time the device will no longer stay on, even when charged at 100%, the only way to use the device is to plug it into the charger, otherwise it just turns off and will not start back up.  I contacted Amazon once again about the issue, however they said it was outside the warranty (by 30 days) and they would give me a new one for the low price of 170 dollars (apparently a discount from what they said).  I declined however as I'm worried about spending more money on a device that fails often and will only last a year.  I have owned numerous tablets both Galaxy and Apple and they continue to work year after year, so why this device is so fragile is beyond me.  My six year old son is not pleased with the results either.  I'll have to research another option for him in the near future.",2015-07-28,0

You can check my other reviews and note that I rate fairly and honestly and that I have been a faithful Amazon customer for many years. I had purchased a Kindle several years back when they were new and eBooks were just coming into vogue. I liked the device (though at the time I was disappointed that Kindle books were often more expensive than paperback versions) and quickly adapted to using it. Unfortunately the screen went berserk and that was the end of that. I continued to purchase Kindle books using my computer to read them because I had been converted to eBooks; however, that does not mean that I had been converted to Kindle devices. That experience with the Kindle device had soured me on Amazon's reader. I like dependable tools and that Kindle failed in that respect. Fast forward to last October and my mother-in-law's diagnosis with terminal brain cancer (she was soon restricted to hospital and nursing home care). To keep her involved in photos and videos of daily family life we purchased a Kindle Fire for her. It was a great way to share photos, books, etc. with her and the Fire performed well for her until she passed on three months later. My wife has used that Fire since then. Fast forward four months later to when my wife purchased a Fire for me even though I had declined purchasing one several times previously when they came on sale at Amazon. I had failed to tell her that I did not trust Amazon's electronic devices [sorry Amazon, great retailer as you are, I do not trust your Kindle devices). I have used it sparingly, mainly because I had become accustomed to using my PC to read Kindle books. The novelty of the reader was diminished because of my first experience with a Kindle reader. Fast forward two months to now: my Kindle Fire HD 7 will not turn on and will not charge. Yes, yes, I have tried every online Google-search remedy (and the charger works on the other Fire).NOTHING works. The magical 20 seconds, 30 seconds, press the On button after, before, and during charging. Wiggle the charging plug gently. Nada, zilch, zero, NOTHING. I even turned around three times with my eyes shut and spit three times. Anybody want an expensive flat paperweight? Anyhow, I have read the many complaints posted here about this device. I have also read the many complaints about Amazon's poor response and support for those many customers who have been maligned by Amazon via this device. I am going to contact Amazon about this. I will post the results. Meanwhile, I do not recommend that you purchase ANY Kindle device. This is not only because of my experience with this device, but because, like other products that I have purchased that are made in China, it is a roll of the dice to learn whether the item received is the result of good quality control or of poor quality control. I avoid Chinese products because I have found them to be unreliable (in one case, the item never arrived and neither did the replacement for it).  UPDATE:  Amazon responded very quickly--before I had the opportunity to call them! The day following my review Amazon contacted us and initiated forwarding another Fire.

This AM I thought I'd see what it does.  VOICE TO TEXT !  And it rocks!  Years ago I remember buying software for my computer that was supposed to do that, it did ... sort of.  It mangled the translations so bad that it took longer to fix it than to type it in the first place. Haven't used it a lot YET,  but this one is awesome.  Most of the translation is perfect other than you have to add caps, punctuation etc.  Far less to fix than UNcorrecting auto corrected text.  This is going to get a LOT of use. Seems to work on any program that accepts text input.  (I've tried 3 so far.)  Love it!

Another design flaw comes with the power button. It is almost right on the charger, and is easy to hit when plugging in/unplugging the tablet.

I actually enjoy the size of it and feel of it.  I also own an Ipad 2, which was my first purchase a few years ago, but that was actually cumbersome to carry around.  The fire feels to be the perfect blend of an Ipad and a smartphone, which is exactly what I wanted.  Now for the operating system, it feels clean and streamlined. I think for a novice, it would be simple to use, while complex enough to be modified by someone more experience.<br /><br />  There are a few things that upset me about the HD7.  First off, let me say I love personalizing the things I own.  The lock screen on the default OS is not customizable if you wish not to root(a.k.a break into the operating system and load your own... possible to brick/break it also) your tablet.  The default lockscreen also displays ads to you.  Now this isn't a game breaker as this is a lockscreen, but I would have expected it to be changeable.  Another thing was when I started using it, I would have my battery drain in sleep mode.  I was able to fix that problem by googling battery drain for the HD7, but if you are like me.. you won't always have a charger nearby.. (sidenote: The battery life is great since the drain has been resolved)<br /><br />  Overall I am glad I purchased the Fire HD7.  At ~$140 I was wary to spend that on another tablet, but I felt the Primeday discount made it hard to pass up.  For what it's worth.. if I had to buy this again, even at full price, I wouldn't mind it one bit.",2015-07-26,1

If you're looking for a tablet with simple needs and wants, this is definitely a good choice.  Given, I got it on sale, but even at the price it is, on deal or not, it is a great choice. Always needs some improvement; the camera could definitely use an upgrade.  The app store could allow some products - instagram for example - to be free, but that may just be my prejudice since Im a bit android, and thus a google play, fan.<br /><br />Like i said, it can always use improvement, but it does still allow free netflix, pandora, and facebook.  Plus the music stations are plentiful and pleases me enough - not to even mentioning the quality of it's instant stream videos (even though that could always use an expansion.) Games could add a few classics for free, since I'm not a fan of angry birds, temple run, etc I like my minesweaper, snake, poker, and such (24 but still a little old school.)<br /><br />Overall, like I said, it's a great tablet and easily a good choice for the simple &#34;portable computer&#34; needs.  Even the web browser is decent and still allows you to use google search; I was a bit worried when I first opened it up and it used the Bing search engine haha. \<br /><br />It doesn't match the range of abilities an android tablet allows, but it is still a good choice when it comes to an affordable and very useful product",2015-07-25,1

So I deleted almost all my games to get it,(because it used a lot of space) and I still couldn't get it.<br /><br />  The weird thing is I only had one game that barely used any storage space  on it so I was like what ever and I tried down loading another game that I deleted to try  to get that game. And it wouldn't dowlnoad! And that was strange, so I checked on my storage and it said that the storage was so filled that the internet wouldn't work. So I deleted a couple things, and the internet was still locked!<br /><br />  So to end my review I have to say that...

Forget It","Let me first say that I am generally very happy with Amazon, and I have had Kindles since 2010. The problem is that if you avail yourself of the free Kindle book promotions that are constantly happening in addition to your occasional regular ebook purchases, you will amass several thousand in your account. And before long, you could easily have more than 10,000, 20,000, or 30,000 or more. Now I'm NOT talking about trying to put all of these books onto the Kindle--it simply won't be able to, nor would I want to. I'm simply talking about having these &#34;purchased&#34; Kindle books in your account, ready to download at your whim. When I got my HD7 16GB last week, I followed all the instructions. So far so good. Until I simply clicked on &#34;Books.&#34; Mistake. It went to the Books--Cloud section and began trying to list all 17,000 or so books in my account. I let this run for several hours. I found that If I clicked on Home while this was running, then it took about 5 minutes (yes, minutes!) for it to change to my Home screen. And this is BEFORE I had downloaded a single book to the unit!<br /><br />So I left it plugged in to the charger overnight and hoped for the best the next day. But there was no improvement after an entire day had passed. Basically, because I have a lot of &#34;purchased&#34; Kindle books in my Amazon account, this Kindle is useless. I have a first original Kindle Fire that I was hoping to upgrade for this one, but sadly, the original Fire outperforms this HD7.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it will probably work just fine for you if you curb your appetite for free Kindle books and keep your total significantly below the 10,000 count. (I don't really know what the count needs to be under for the Kindle to not bog down, so it could even be maybe 5,000?) Again, I really wanted this HD7 to work, but it is apparent that the designers at Amazon are ignoring those of us who have many many purchased Kindle books in our accounts. Not very forward-looking in my opinion, since eventually there will be more and more Kindle customers who will collect very high numbers of Kindle books in their accounts. AGAIN: I'm not talking about downloading these books on the Kindle! I'm simply saying that the Kindle bogs waaaaaaaay down because of the high number of Kindle books that are available in my Amazon account. Kindles need to be designed to accommodate ALL of the customers' accounts, not just those who don't buy very many ebooks.",2015-07-23,0

My eight year old son purchased the Kindle fire with his own “hard=earned” money we chipped in for the extended warranty and the case knowing that there could be issues with and Eight year old and a tablet. We were sold due to the sophistication of the parental controls and how we thought they will encourage his reading. Within a month the product froze up, under warranty we got an easy exchange, after that switch the tablet lasted a year when the screen shut down. As the tech support identified the screen as “dead”, and as we are two month past the warranty there is nothing they can do about it, no fix, no exchange, but a “discounted” price which is higher than currently sold outright on a retailer or in the Amazon market place. So my son has a $200 paperweight and Amazon expect me to purchase another one. (By the way he took great care of it, no dings, nicks or even scratches) I understand about planned obsolescence but two tablets within a year seem extreme, and makes this more of a disposable product than I could recommend. My wife has an iPad, and I have a nexus, both products are excellent and worth the cost. If Amazon’s expectations is that we will purchase a new one every year,  in three years you have already paid for the iPad which has more apps, more programs and more capacity, even less to  pay for the nexus, mine even got wet and still works. If you’re looking for a disposable tablet that lasts a year, go ahead and get as you will save some money but if you expect the product to last longer than that, get something else as not only it will cost the same but you have to add the hassle of having to deal with customer service every time it goes down.

I explained paid for a screen cover and didn't expect to have to purchase another one a couple months later, so she said there would be one in my shipment.  I thought great and wonderful customer service. When I got my package my screen cover wasn't there. I called explaining my situation and was told they do not give the covers out for free. Eventually, after two hours three calls, one hang up on me and a supervisor later I got my screen cover. Of course, it doesn't fit my Fire. Horrible product and experience. I love buying stuff on Amazon!! I am a prime member! This experience just reminded me that Amazon should stick to fulfillment (pick, packing and shipping).  I am sad and just wanted to share my experience and the lesson I learned.",2015-07-18,0

I am having one very specific problem for which there appears to be no fix. When signing into a third party internet service (the type of service used by hotels, restaurants and hospital waiting rooms, for example), I cannot get a wifi connection. If the site needs an acceptance of terms sign-in, it just sits there in la-la land. In a hotel that I stay in regularly, I call their internet help desk and they can get me logged in by adding my mac address manually. It's a time-consuming process and very annoying. They have told me this is a regular problem with the newer Kindle Fires. My previous Kindle Fire did not have this problem. But the Fire HD 7 does.  I've talked to tech support and the only suggestion they have for me is to try restoring to factory and reinstalling my stuff (can anyone say royal pain in the . . .?) or calling them when I get to one of the places where my wifi won't work.

I am giving it a 4 and not a 5 because of a few things. First of all, I do not appreciate that my start screen is an ad for Amazon Coins. I paid a lot of money for this so I should have an ad free tablet! But, still that is not that annoying. Hoping I can find a way to get that off of there. Then the other thing is that it is a little confusing where to find things I need. I suppose that will get better with time so maybe my review will go up to a 5 eventually. One other negative this is that it won't let me access my Prime Music. It says I need to renew my Prime membership. My Prime membership does not expire until December! So now the good. The picture quality is really good. I have easy access to Kindle books which is the main reason we bought it. It has a lot of apps and games just like any tablet. The layout is big and easy to see.
